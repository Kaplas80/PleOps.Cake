We will cover how to integrate a full featured DevOps workflow into your .NET
projects. This includes:

- 🔧 .NET project building, testing and publishing to NuGet feeds
- 📃 Documentation project building and publishing to GitHub Pages
- 📦 Dependency management
- 📉 Git workflow for features, patches and releases
- 🆕 Versioning and release management
- 🤖 Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines

At the end of this guide you will have a project ready to release with a
continuous integration system like GitHub Actions.
